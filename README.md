# Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256)

## Program Definition
This is a program for Theory of Algorithms module of 4th year of Software Development. This repository contains code which is able to run SHA-256 on passed in files.

## Problem Statement
You must write a program in the C programming languaage that calculates the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is specified in the Secure Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology. The only pre-requisite is that your program performs the algorithm - you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on. I suggest you allow the user to input some free text or a filename via the command line.

## SHA-256
* SHA256 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit and itâ€™s used for cryptographic security.
* Cryptographic hash algorithms produce irreversible and unique hashes. The larger the number of possible hashes, the smaller the chance that two values will create the same hash. 
* Is defined as one of the most secure ways to protect digital information. SHA 256 is a math process that generates a 256 bit (64 character long) random sequence of letters and numbers (hash) out of any input.
* A hash is as a mathematical computer process that takes information and turns it into letters and numbers of a certain length. Hashing is used to make storing and finding information quicker because hashes are usually shorter and easier to find. Hashes also make information unreadable and so the original data can become confidential.
* The number of possible combinations of letters and numbers produced by SHA 256 exceeds the number grains of sand on Earth! That makes guessing the data hidden within the hash virtually impossible. Hashes cannot be reversed, so the process is typically used for computer security.
